# Alchimia

**Theme: Every 10 seconds**

You're in charge of running a fantasy potion shop

Game is separated into play sessions - in game days.
Each day new client comes in every 10 seconds.
Every client has a list of potions they want to buy.

You have a list of recipes for different potions.
Each recipe contains:
- ingridients list
- each ingridient has associated action that has to be performed on it
- time of preparation

Each action is a minigame.
There are multiple screens for each stage of potion preparation.

When ingridients are prepared they go to brewing station where they go into the cauldron for some time.

The game starts easy with limited ingridients and recipes. As you progress you unlock new stuff. The game also gets harder as new clients want to buy more than one potion.

## Ingridient actions
- cutting (button mashing)
- griding (mouse spinning?)
- burning (keeping falling indicator in the right place)
- enchanting (qte)
